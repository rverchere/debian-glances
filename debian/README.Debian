HTML Output is not working out of the box.

It is however possible to get it working. Glances should be run within a folder
containing html, css and img folders.
They are located in /usr/share/glances/

For instance:

	mkdir /tmp/glances
	cd /tmp/glances
	for dir in css img html; do ln -sf usr/share/glances/$dir;done
	glances -o html -f /tmp/glances
